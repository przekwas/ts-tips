# TypeScript Tips

Welcome to the 'ts-tips' project! This repository contains all the code examples used in our TypeScript Tips series.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. This project uses TypeScript as a dev dependency, which will be installed in the next steps.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/przekwas/ts-tips
    ```
   
2. Navigate into the project folder:

    ```sh
    cd ts-tips
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Usage

To start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode, run:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This will compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript anytime you make a change in the `app.ts` file.
